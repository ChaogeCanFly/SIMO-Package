# SIMO-Package

## Introduction

SIMO-Package is a basic NURBS-based IsoGeometric Analysis package written in MATLAB.

## Modules

### Rotation-free beam theory (Kirchhoff-Love beam theory)
### Linear Static Elasticity (including 1D, 2D, 3D elements for single patch and muti-patches problems)
### Gradient Elasticity (we are still working on it)
### IGLA
### Linear Static Heat Tranfer
